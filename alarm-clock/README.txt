Name of Program: 'alarm.py'

Needed modules: 'pygame'

Running instructions: Put your favorite '.mp3' file in the current directory, and run the program. 
You will be asked if you would like to set an alarm or timer. When the desired time is reached.
'alarm.py' is ran it will look for an mp3 file, that is not 'maze.mp3'. Otherwise it will play
'maze.mp3'. 

Assumptions: User understands 24H format. A sound output is set up to allow 
program to play '.mp3' file and for it to be heard.

Note: 'maze.mp3' is not owned by me. Music is owned by 'Alisha_Sutudo'.
